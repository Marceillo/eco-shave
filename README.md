**Project Objectives:**

# Business Model

So in actually fact each time a customer uses these products they are helping the enviroment and saving at the same time.

## DE and SE Shaving – The Philosophy

* The shaving razors are the best in my opinion after you go through a small learning curve you get the best shaves.
* Its a customizible shave where you can change differant assesories such as blades and soaps even your shaving  routine plays a role, the list goes on and on each can 
  give you a diffrant shave.
* Why not turn a everyday shave into a hobby and somthing to look forward to doing.
* DE double edge is newer than the SE single edge razors that dat as far back as the Egyptians even further probibly. 
* It is a product that can last and the longer it lasts the more you are saving, I will say its a tool that keeps giving.
* It helps the enviroment my using a product longer and leaving no wast when discarded.Mostly they are given to another generation.

# Design

## Colours

* I used colors to match the background which is a moving mp4, more about that below in visual experience.

 <img src="static/readme/images/backgroundmp4.png"><br>

### Colour Scheme

* Used a [Coolors web site](https://coolors.co/palettes/trendin) to search for colors that match.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Typography

* The Roboto font is the main font, and Lato is the secondary font used for the whole project.

## Initial ERD Diagram

<details>
<summary>My Intial ERD Diagram</summary>

* For the initial ERD diagram plan, I used [lucid chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
<br>
<br>
<img src="static/readme/images/lucid_erd_diagram.png">
<br>
<br>
</details>

## Django ERD Diagram
<details>
<summary>Used code Django to get an ERD.dot file and convert it to ERD Diagram</summary>
Django has a built-in tool that can show you your ERD diagram.

### Reason 

* It is not always possible to start a project from scratch sometimes it may be the case that you need to work on someone else project.
* So this will give me as a developer an overview of the project from an ERD standpoint.

### Steps used
* Step 1 to using this is to install python3 -m pip install django-extensions.
* Step 2 would be to add the installed apps in settings.
* Step 3 would be to add it to the requirements file.
* Step 4 is to run the python manage.py graph_models -a --output erd.dot 
* Step 5 After this it will create an erd. dot file with all the application model data.
* Step 6 Put the data in this software to change to an image file much like the one I used below.

The red dot file converted to image [Graphviz online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/#digraph%20G%20%7B%0A%0A%20%20subgraph%20cluster_0%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20style%3Dfilled%3B%0A%20%20%20%20color%3Dlightgrey%3B%0A%20%20%20%20node%20%5Bstyle%3Dfilled%2Ccolor%3Dwhite%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20a0%20-%3E%20a1%20-%3E%20a2%20-%3E%20a3%3B%0A%20%20%20%20label%20%3D%20%22process%20%231%22%3B%0A%20%20%7D%0A%0A%20%20subgraph%20cluster_1%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20node%20%5Bstyle%3Dfilled%5D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20b0%20-%3E%20b1%20-%3E%20b2%20-%3E%20b3%3B%0A%20%20%20%20label%20%3D%20%22process%20%232%22%3B%0A%20%20%20%20color%3Dblue%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20start%20-%3E%20a0%3B%0A%20%20start%20-%3E%20b0%3B%0A%20%20a1%20-%3E%20b3%3B%0A%20%20b2%20-%3E%20a3%3B%0A%20%20a3%20-%3E%20a0%3B%0A%20%20a3%20-%3E%20end%3B%0A%20%20b3%20-%3E%20end%3B%0A%0A%20%20start%20%5Bshape%3DMdiamond%5D%3B%0A%20%20end%20%5Bshape%3DMsquare%5D%3B%0A%7D)

### Shoppping Bag Page

* Note: The bag app was really difficult to setup when not doing it exactly like the LMS.
* - Side note I had little support from tutoring team as they kept instructing me to make it similar to the LMS. 
* - Learning is about trying new things and making mistakes, I believe from this I learnt that variables should be consistant.
* - Problem 1: The adding of image and date to the bag app. Solution was had to redo the bag/views,context.py several times.
* - Problem 2: The remove button was not working as I was not consistently using strings for keys, after all the refactoring and print logs problem resolved.
* Styling : I used a [free template](https://bbbootstrap.com/snippets/bootstrap-ecommerce-shopping-cart-item-summary-44021562) and customised it to the bag app

<details>

<summary>Login and Logout Page summary</summary>

* Once you enter your e-mail address you will see this screen as a user.

<br>

![Login](/static/readme/images/passwordresetmessage.png)


##### NOTE:

* The link will be sent to the IDE terminal and only to certain email service providers.
* The reason for this is that certain service providers block Django messages on the server side such as Gmail.
* This is not a live site and not in control of the SMTP server I have to accept this result.

###### Terminal link view

![Style of the Message](/static/readme/images/message-style.png)

</details>

### Future Features

* Originally I planned the like feature to include in the project but due to time constraints and having met the MPV criteria, I would like to come back to this project and include it at a later stage.I have since moved it to a won't have status on the Kanban Board.  
* For the contact form it would be great at a later stage to set up an API with Javascript and implement a feature when a user sends their details that it goes to an email address of the admin.
* The Favorite feature is working as planned but if the site should grow I will need to change it into a separate link on the page as this method makes it easier for users to keep track of their project favorites.
* At The moment the colors are my favorite but there is always room for improvement also for the design and flow of the blog posts. Due to time, this was the biggest issue for me in this regard.
* As a kayaker we often have meetups and would like to include a feature that will assist with the logistics and dates of their meetups.
* A feature to join in on classes or book an instructor for some time.
* An online training program with video guides and information.
* In the far future people to be able to sell their equipment and buy from others on the platform.
* I did not inlcude Pagination for the amount of blog posts this would be great to come back to and update at later date.

## Database

The project uses the PostgreSQL database for storing the data.

## Agile Methodology
This project was developed using the Agile methodology.<br>
All epics and user stories implementation progress was registered using [Github](https://github.com/users/Marceillo/projects/8). As the user stories were accomplished, they were moved in the Kanban Board from **Epic**,**User stories**, **No Status**, **To Do**, to **In-progress**, and **Done** lists.

I added sprints to help with organizing the project and MoSCoW prioritization Labels were also included in each issue. Additionally, I included tasks for some guidance as to what needs to be done.

# Deployment of this project
<details>
<summary>Deployment from terminal to Heroku</summary>

### Helpfull guide links 

[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/install/)
[Django Central](https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/#pre-requirements)

* A small note: This is a simple guide of how to get the app up and running.
* Should certain section not seem clear there is a large number of recources that can clarify the below steps if not clear.

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). To deploy a project, these are the steps:

1. Begin by creating a GitHub repository I used this template [Code Institute template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template). Navigate to template and select use. THis was the step I used you can create this in a differant way.

2. 'Create Repository From the Template.

3. After the repository is created, click on 'Gitpod'.

4. Install Django by entering this command in the terminal:

* ```pip3 install Django~=4.2.1``` 
* Best is to see what is the latest verstion and if compatible with the software you plan to install.

5. Generate a requirements file using the following command:

* ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` - This will create the requirements.txt file and adds required libraries to it. This command needs to exectuted every time a new libary gets added to the project.

6. Create your project:

* ```django-admin startproject YOUR_PROJECT_NAME .``` - "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME" is the name you choose for your project.

7. Create your application using:

* ```python3 manage.py startapp APP_NAME``` - This will create your application with the name "APP-NAME"

8. Add your local server to "ALLOWED_HOSTS" in the settings.py file. For this you need to run the command

* ```python3 manage.py runserver``` - This runs the server. This will give you an error message "DisallowedHost at /", following the link of your local server. Copy this link and add it in your settings.py file.
* While in the settings.py file, also add your newly created app in the "INSTALLED_APPS" section at the bottom of the list. In the picture, the first app is called "APP".

9. To get the code ready for deployment, gunicorn needs to be installed and added to the requirements with the following commands:

* ```pip3 install gunicorn~=20.1``` - This installs gunicorn
* ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` - This will add gunicorn to the requirements.txt file

10. Create a file in the root directory named "Procfile" and add the nessesary lines to the settings.py file:

- Procfile:
* ```web: gunicorn "proejec_name".wsgi``` - "project_name" stands for the name of your project
- settings.py:
* ```DEBUG = False``` - This is the debug line in the settings.py file. It is very important that debug is never set to "True" on a deployed webpage for security reasons. While in development, DEBUG should be set to "True"
* ```,'.herokuapp.com'``` needs to be added to the "ALLOWED_HOSTS" section in the settings.py file, so that heroku has the permission to access the project.

11. Now it is time to create the application on Heroku:

* Head on to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in (or create an account if needed).

* In the top right corner there is a button that is labeled 'New'. Click that and then select 'Create new app'.

12. On Heroku, enter a unique application name, choose your region, and click 'Create app':

13. I used thePostgres database provided by Code Institute, [PostgresSQL](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) in the LMS course material.

* Press "Reveal Config Vars" and add "DATABASE_URL" as key and enter the postgres URL, which has been sent by email, as the value.
* Addistionally, add the "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" key with a value of "1" as a second config var. This is nessesary for the later implementation of the Cloudinary API.

14. In GitPod, create an env.py file in the top-level directory with the following content:

* ```import os``` - This imports the os library
* ```os.environ("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://*********************")``` - This sets database variable to your PostgresSQL database.
* ```os.environ("SECRET_KEY", "actual_secret_key")``` - You can create your own key with a webpage like [RandomKeyGen](https://randomkeygen.com/).
* if using the Code Institute template, the env.py file should already be in the "gitignore" file, if not, it has to be added manually.

15. Add your secret key to Heroku's Config Vars and your env variables used: Look at step 13

16. In settings.py, add the following code:

```import os```

```import dj_database_url```

```if os.path.isfile("env.py"):```

```import env```

17. Replace the insecure secret key in settings.py with:
```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')```

18. Comment out the old database settings and add the link to DATABASE_URL since the project does not use the standart sqlite3 database. 

```DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))}```

18. Save all your fields and migrate the changes with the following commands:

```python3 manage.py migrate```

19. Set up Cloudinary for static file storage: After creating a Cloudinary account, you can copy the API Environment Variable from the Cloudinary dashboard.

20. In the env.py file, add the Cloudinary url (it's very important that the url is unaltered):

```os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "cloudinary://*********************************")```

21. In the Config Vars of heroku, add the Cloudinary url (CLOUDINARY_URL as the key, the actual url as the value). 

22. In the settings.py file, the Cloudinary Libraries have to be added to the installed apps. The correct order is very important.

23. In the bottom of settings.py, add additional settings for static file management:

24. The next step is to link the file to the Heroku templates directory:

25. Now edit the templates directory to "TEMPLATES_DIR" in the teamplates array.

26. Some more files are needed before deploying:

* Create 2 folders in the top level directory: **static** and **templates**
* The **static** folder will include all CSS and JS files as well as images.
* The **templates** folder will include the "base.html" file, as well as all django related templates.

27. Make sure that all the files are saved, then enter the following lines in the console for the first commit and push to Github:

* ```python3 manage.py collectstatic ``` 
* ```git add .```
* ```git commit -m "Deployment commit"```
* ```git push```


30. Now it's time for deployment. Scroll to the top of the settings page in Heroku and click the 'Deploy' tab. For deployment method, select 'Github'. Search for the repository name you want to deploy and then click connect.

31. Scroll down to the manual deployment section and click 'Deploy Branch'.

The live link to the site on Heroku an be found [Kayak Blog](https://kayak-blog-pp4-1054055911f7.herokuapp.com/). And the Github repository can be found [github](https://github.com/Marceillo/kayak-blog-pp4).

#### Extra variables added to the env file.

* The below variables where added after the intial deploment 
* ```os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "your_email_password")``` sets the default values for the email host user and password environment variables. Which are used to configure the email sending functionality for the forgot password feature when deploying your application to Heroku.

## Final Deployment 

1. Create a runtime.txt `python-3.8.13`
2. Create a Profile `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi`
3. When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
4. In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`

5. To get the project to work, install the required dependencies using the command below:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
6. This step is to set up the environment file so that the project knows what variables that needs to be used for it to work. Environment variables are usually hidden due to sensitive information. It's very important that you don't push the env.py file to Github (this can be secured by adding env.py to the .gitignore-file). The variables that are declared in the env.py file needs to be added to the Heroku config vars. Don't forget to do necessary migrations before trying to run the server.

* ```python3 manage.py migrate``` - This will do the necessary migrations.
* ```python3 manage.py runserver``` - If everything i setup correctly the project is now live locally.
* ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser ``` - Create super user as you will need this to access the admin panel.
7. In GitPod, create an env.py file in the top-level directory with the following content:
* ```import os``` - This imports the os library
* ```os.environ("DATABASE_URL", "postgres://*********************")``` - This sets database variable to your PostgresSQL database.
* ```os.environ("SECRET_KEY", "actual_secret_key")``` - You can create your own key with a webpage like [RandomKeyGen](https://randomkeygen.com/).
* ```os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "your_email_password","DEVELOPMENT", "1")```sets the default values for the email host user and password environment variables
